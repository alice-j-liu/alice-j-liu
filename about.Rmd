I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic young professional in the field of finance. As a statistician, I am eager to continue learning the theory and application of statistics and various fields of research. 

I maintain a strong work ethic in both a relaxed and pressurized work environment, and work well both by myself and on a team. I possess strong communication and teaching skills, obtained through consulting working with a variety of different non-statisticians and being fully responsible for several undergraduate-level statistics courses.
